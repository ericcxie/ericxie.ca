Things 3 is an award-winning task manager app developed by Germany-based software company Cultured Code. It is available across all Apple platforms — sorry, Android and Windows users.

As a student, it can get challenging to keep track of every assignment and due date. So when I went on my search for the "perfect" to-do app, Things 3 seemed to get all the praise. However, my initial impression of the price came at a shock like many others. $112 for the entire bundle here in Canada seemed a bit unjustifiable at first.

Things 3 pricing (CAD):

- $12.99 on iPhone
- $27.99 on iPad
- $69.99 on Mac (optional [15-day free trial](https://culturedcode.com/things/download/))

After all, it is just a task manager app. So this brings in the question of whether or not this highly praised app is worth it. After a couple of months of use, I believe that I can help settle that.

## What I look for in a task manager app as a student

Everyone has different criteria for what they look for in a to-do app. Some may be more than happy with the native reminders app, while others seek more features.

As a university student, the reminders app just didn't meet my criteria. I felt that features were often limited. To put it simply, the Apple reminders app is great for simple tasks like a grocery list but falls behind when you've got multiple assignments due within the same week. Here are the criteria that I look for in a to-do app.

- **Tags**: this seems like an obvious criterion when it comes to organization. The ability to add tags allows for better categorization of tasks and helps sharpen your focus. Seeing a list of tasks with no indication of what aspect of my life it belongs can feel overwhelming.
- **Ease of use**: I want an app that allowed me to add tasks and reminders easily. I don't want to spend 5 minutes figuring out how to add a reminder, as that isn't efficient.
- **Project management**: majority of students have multiple projects at a given time. Whether that be for school, work, or personal. I want to separate my individual projects and organize tasks and reminders dependent on the project.
- **Multi-device support**: nowadays, most people have multiple types of devices. An app like a task manager needs to have the ability to sync across all of your devices. It should be as easy as entering a task on your phone and checking it off on your laptop.
- **Aesthetics**: this may come across as a bit controversial, but I want an app that looks good. Obviously, the functions are a more critical criterion, but an app's feel can also play an important factor in your productivity. I want to *want* to use the app.

## Why Things 3?

Everything that I was looking for in a task-manager app, Things 3 seems to have. It features a clean and modern design. Simple and easy to use yet packed with features. Everything that it does well in just works. Here are the top most useful features that I found with my testing.

1. The inbox

The inbox allows the user to add any tasks or reminders without the need for a "plan." Sometimes, we may have a task that we want to set but don't exactly have a plan for how or when we'll do this task. Adding it to the inbox is a quick way to get it off your mind to revisit it later.

1. Projects

This was the feature that lured me into Things 3 initially. The ability to create several projects helps better organize your tasks. Instead of having an extensive list of tasks that needs to be completed from different assignments, you can create a project instead and add tasks accordingly. Then, after you finish the project, simply check it off just like any other task. There's just something so fulfilling about that.

1. Calendar events

Things 3 allows users to connect their Calendar and displays every event on a timeline. Seeing every event and task on one timeline makes your life feel so much more organized.

1. Sub-tasks

To take it even further, you can add a checklist within a task. It can be very useful when you have a main task, and you need to add simple to-do's to help get the task completed.

## Conclusion

Although Things 3 can be a bit pricey compared with the other options on the market, I personally think it is worth it.

It has helped me become more organized and productive in the different areas of my life. What's nice about the app is just how simple it is to use, and that's exactly what you want in a task manager app. Something that just works and works well. I often found myself looking forward to completing my tasks just for that brief satisfaction of checking it off on the app.

Here's my verdict, if you are a student and money is tight, just try the $12.99 iPhone app or the 15-day free trial for the Mac. There's no reason to commit to the whole bundle at once. Also, keep in mind that this is a one-time purchase. Many other to-do apps nowadays require subscriptions which can add up in price. It's not like you're changing an app every other month. So if you can afford it, I say go for it.

If you are looking for a tool to help you take control and organize your life, I believe that Things 3 provides an excellent experience, helping your life feel just a bit more manageable.
